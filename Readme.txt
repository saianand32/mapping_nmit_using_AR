Mapping_nmit was built by me and my team at NMIT hackathon 2021 for the purpose of helping out freshers to get to know the college better using augmented reality.
This project was a great success and won the First place in the hackathon. The application was built using UNITY, VUFORIA engine and C# scripts to access GPS location of the device and display various parts of the college in a virtual environment which would enable newcomers to know the college much better.


Since the project is too big the files are on my drive and the link is attached below
